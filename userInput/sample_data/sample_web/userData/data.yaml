            As a fellow Lover of Holiday Time, I wanted to share with you some
            exciting news for the New Year.
          </div>
          <div class="zeropara1">
            It seems most people establish New Year’s resolutions, but for
            whatever reason, they fall short of keeping them. Each year I
            highlight a great book that helped me and my team 
            dramatically
            improve our follow through on achieving important goals and I
            wanted to share that with you – as sort of a 
            Happy New Year After
            Christmas Gift; more on the book in a moment.
          </div>
          <div class="zeropara1">
            Some of your friends, neighbors, associates or relatives may have
            a New Year’s resolution to make a move. Well, we can help them
            with that, help you and help the community at Ananda Thirtha Vidyalaya
            at the same time. 
           (see inside for details).
