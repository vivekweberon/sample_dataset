            As a fellow Lover of Holiday Time, I wanted to share with you some
            exciting news for the New Year.

          <div class="zeropara1">
            It seems most people establish New Year’s resolutions, but for
            whatever reason, they fall short of keeping them. Each year I
            highlight a great book that helped me and my team 
            dramatically
            improve our follow through on achieving important goals and I
            wanted to share that with you – as sort of a 
            Happy New Year After
            Christmas Gift; more on the book in a moment.
          </div>
          <div class="zeropara1">
            Some of your friends, neighbors, associates or relatives may have
            a New Year’s resolution to make a move. Well, we can help them
            with that, help you and help the community at Ananda Thirtha Vidyalaya
            at the same time.

        I came to the United States 35 years ago, as an engineering student<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span> As I left 
        India and my loving middle class family<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span> I carried with me the value of dreaming
        BIG and persevering that dream  with determination and deep dedication<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span> I am at a 
        very comfortable place today<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span> However, the one thing that still haunts me is the 
        awareness that 45% of the children around the world die of malnutrition (source: worldhunger<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span>org)<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span>
        Even though we have enough food supply to feed 7<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span>7 billion people, we let these 
        children die every hour<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span> Is it not deeply disconcerting to say the least?</p><br>
        The idea of making a difference started with my visit to our housemaids hut, 
        devoid of all the basic necessities, in addition to the lack of a bathroom<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span>
        The faces of her two malnourished children held the blueprint to their everyday 
        life compelling me to think about sharing<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span> It seems magical that these kids are 
        now grown up healthy, educated, and have settled comfortably carrying forward what 
        they received in generosity<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span></p><br>Encouraged by this real life experience, we are 
        personally committed to the mission of 'lifting' these most deserving children<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span> 
        Your referrals will be the most valuable endeavor<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span> Our professional commitment to you 
        is that we earnestly provide not only outstanding results to our buyers and sellers, but also benefit a deserving underprivileged child<SPAN STYLE="font-family:'arial'">.</span>
